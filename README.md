# wizard-lizards
a game of wizard lizards

Forget the idea that a wizard duel is a one-time meeting. It's an orchestrated engagement that can take years, during which alliances can form and break, discoveries are made, recon conducted, towers built and hidden, relics uncovered and shattered, and the flow of mana charted, explored, tested, distorted, altered, broken, poisoned, and enhanced.

The result isn't always a clear win -sometimes it's a stalemate. Sometimes, someone dies - other times, they're reduced to servitude

But you're not just wizards - you're LIZARD wizards. You must bask in mana to keep warm, but if you have too much mana, you'll cook. You must balance your own position in the flow of heat and cool if you're to survive.
